Your CD1 Group Project Report & Software Deliverables
======================================================
  (by LeongHW, July 2016)

Your project title will be 
   "Big Data Community Detection using <Alg>."
where <Alg> = Single-Link Clustering, Girvan-Newman Algorithm, Markov Clustering
is the CD algorithm used by your group.

The deliverable for the CD1 group project will include
 * a short project report (5-7 pages)
 * project software: (code+scripts, data, experiment results, README.txt)


==============
How to Submit:
==============
Create a folder called Group-XX-CD1-Project 
  a subfolder called Report 
    contains project report (in pdf version, and .doc or .tex, etc)
  a subfolder called 
    Software that contains all your Project Software listed below.

Zip up the folder, with name 
    Group-XX-CD1-Project.zip
and submit this to the CD1-Project folder on IVLE Workbin.


==================
Project Software:
==================
is a software collection that includes 
 * code (including those you coded, and those code from others),
 * scripts (if any) that you write to run things, to track things, plot stuffs, etc.
 * datasets (those given to you, and those you created yourself, or you found elsewhere),
 * result files (from running the CD algorithms, communities, visualizations, etc),
 * project report,

 * README.txt simple file that documents all the above 
    - list out all the files in this software collection
    - list out all external dependencies (R packages that you use, 
        other software libraries that you use, 
        programming languages, compilers, interpreters needed, 
        particular software environment that you install and 
        is necessary to run your program; etc;
    - with proper acknowledgement of contribution from others
        (like code/data you downloaded from where, timestamp, 
        or data generated by a friend.) 


================
Project Report:
================
This is a short report, about 5-7 pages, including references, 
and excluding appendix, if applicable. 
(At least 12point font size at 1.5 line spacing.)

The format and organization of the report can vary, but it should
contain the following (or its equivalent):

  Proper Title Page 
  Introduction
  Problem Statement
  Brief Description of the CD Algorithm used
  Complexity Analysis
  Experiment Setup and Datasets Used
  Result, Visualization and Analysis
  Conclusion
  Teamwork in this project
  Lessons Learnt
  Acknowledgement (if applicable)
  Reference
  Appendix (if applicable)

We briefly describe each section.

A Proper Title Page:
====================
  project title, your project group, names of group member

Introduction
============
  General introduction of the general area, and application/use.
  Also a high-level statement of the goal(s) and scope of the project.

Problem Statement
=================
  More precise statement of the problem. 
  And, if relevant, a quick survey of relevant solution methods.
  Keep that part short.

Brief Description of the Community Detection Algorithm used
===========================================================
  Should include the specific algorithm you used in the project.
  Give the technical details of your algorithm here. (Can just
  "copy and paste" the algorithm from the original paper, with
  proper credit --- like, 
  "The algorithm XXX, as presented by [27] is given in Figure 4."

  State parameters that the algorithm uses and describe briefly
  how you choose the values of these parameters for your own
  evaluation. If you only use the "default" parameters, without
  adjustment, you can also say so.

Complexity Analysis
===================
  State the time complexity of your algorithm. (Usually already
  given in the original paper. If you can, you can give a high
  level (rough overview) of the analysis of the running time.
  If you can't, you can just state the running time, as given 
  in the original paper. 

Experiment Setup and Datasets Used
==================================
  Explain the datasets used for your evaluation study of your algorithm. 
  State the computer systems (HW/SW) that is used to run the
  experiments, and parameters, if relevant.

Result, Visualization and Analysis
==================================
  Next, the important part, learn how to properly present the
  results of your study -- in this case, the communities computed.
  Describe any analysis you did on the results-and-data and
  give details of your analysis.
  Describe any observations you can make from these analyses.

  (Present your results in such a way that it is easy or obvious
  to support any observation(s) you make about the algorithm(s)
  that you are studying.)

Conclusion
==========
  Some general conclusion from this project work. 
  Some recommendations on additional future work that can be 
  done if you have more time.  

Teamwork in this project
========================
  Describe how you work as a team, how the tasks were divided
  and how you all communicated with each other. List any teamwork 
  problems encountered. And if so, how you solve them.

Lessons Learnt
==============
  Your personal description of the lesson(s) you have learnt
  from doing this project. This could include lesson on 
  academic learning, research methods, software development, 
  or other non-academic skills.
  And maybe state, if you can restart this project, 
  what, if any, would you have done differently.
 
Acknowledgement
===============
  Who you like to thanks (your parents, boy/girl friends, 
  your dog, whatever). KEEP IT SHORT.

Appendix (if applicable)

==============
Final Remarks:
==============
Finally, the style and format of the report and the lengths of the different
sections can vary widely depending on what you actually did in the project.
Some sections can be very short if you do not have much to say.
